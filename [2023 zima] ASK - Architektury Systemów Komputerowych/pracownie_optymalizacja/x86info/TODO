higher priority stuff
---------------------
- handle error better in mptable. Propagate values up.
- feature flag handling code could use more cleanup.
  - Would be nice to have something similar to the kernels CPU_HAS macros too.
- Make intel cache sizing use cpuid(4) where present.
- After identifying CPU we can associate more info with the CPU.
  - CPU codename
  - Introduction date
  - number of transistors
  - voltages (I/O, Core, Maximum)
  - number of pipelines
- Be able to tell the user when we have failed to identify the chip, so they can send us information!


medium priority stuff
---------------------
- introduce hexdump option (-x) to dump register values in addition to decoding.


low priority stuff
------------------
- Identify Transmeta CPUs.
- Dump cyrix ARR registers when we pass --mtrr
- review code for extended natsemi support.
